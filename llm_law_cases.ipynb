Sixièmement, dès lors que l’on rappelle à nouveau le fait que la \\nrequérante n’était pas en mesure, selon le Gouvernement, de prendre des \\ndécisions éclairées pour son propre compte, le fait qu’elle n’ait pas demandé \\nau tribunal de désigner un nouvel avocat n’est guère pertinent. En outre, bien \\nque la requérante ait dénoncé dans son recours l’absence d’accès à un avocat, \\nla décision très succincte de la Cour de cassation ne porte aucune appréciation \\nsur cette question.\\n9.
